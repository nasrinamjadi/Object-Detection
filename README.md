### ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

This project focuses on object detection, tracking, and knowledge distillation using VLM-based pseudo-labeling and YOLO models. A full description of the task, methodology and results is provided in [report.pdf](report.pdf)
.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| [report.pdf](report.pdf) | Detailed explanation of the task, setup, methodology  and results |
| [dataset/test-data](dataset/test-data) | Four test frames were manually labeled using the LabelImg annotation tool for evaluation purposes|
| 'dataset/unlabeled' | 175 unlabeled images used for knowledge distillation from the VLM to the YOLO model |
| [output-videos/](output-videos/) | Final generated videos produced by the detection and tracking pipeline |
| `*.py` files | Source code for model inference, tracking and evaluation |

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The YOLO model is fine-tuned using unlabeled images, with labels automatically generated by the VLM (Grounding-DINO) model.
- The `test_data` folder is used only for evaluation, not training.
- All detection and tracking outputs are saved in the `output-videos` directory.
