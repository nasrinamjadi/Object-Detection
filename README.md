### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on object detection, tracking, and knowledge distillation using VLM-based pseudo-labeling and YOLO models. A full description of the task, methodology, and results is provided in `report.pdf`.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `report.pdf` | Detailed explanation of the task, setup, methodology, and results |
| `test_data` | Contains 4 labeled frames used for evaluation and testing |
| `dataset` | Unlabeled images used to fine-tune the YOLO model through VLM pseudo-labeling |
| `output-videos` | Final generated videos produced by the detection and tracking pipeline |
| `*.py` files | Source code for model inference, tracking, and evaluation |

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The YOLO model is fine-tuned using unlabeled images, with labels automatically generated by the VLM (Grounding-DINO) model.
- The `test_data` folder is used only for evaluation, not training.
- All detection and tracking outputs are saved in the `output-videos` directory.
